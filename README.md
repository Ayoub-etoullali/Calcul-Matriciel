This project implements basic operations on matrices using the C language. The C language offers high-level instructions and structures while generating fast code thanks to its powerful compiler. Key features include multiplying matrices, transforming matrices into vectors, determining the diagonal and determinant of a square matrix, solving linear systems, etc. This project is intended for anyone interested in matrix operations using the C language.
